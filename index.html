              <p><i>Fiit is a technology start-up on a mission to make fitness addictive.</i></p>
              <p>I helped Fiit launch the initial MVP and first iterations of the product, focusing on API design,
              infrastructure and data processing. This involved working with a small agile team to deliver a boutique
              fitness product in just six months and set the foundations for one of the startups with the biggest growth
              of 2018 London's tech scene.</p>

              right price connecting them with millions of products from the world’s leading designers.</i></p>
              <p>During this period I joined the company to help them rethink their frontend development experience and
              move away from a custom Python framework to make teams more effective. To achieve this we built an
              isomorphic React application and a GraphQL API, progressively migrating different parts of the site.</p>
              <p>Other key responsibilities included recruiting and mentoring other engineers, improve team cohesion,
              ensure the site reliability and tight release processes to ensure rapid delivery.</p>

              <p><i>Smarkets is a betting exchange that offers a platform for trading on sporting, political and current
              affairs events.</i></p>
              <p>I led two different projects for Smarkets. First, a system to extract knowledge from multiple data sources
              to drive marketing decisions. This tool was composed by an ETL Python processor, an Elasticsearch cluster and
              an AngularJS UI to drill down into the data.</p>
              <p>After that, the next project was the creation of a new website and mobile app for the company, in order to
              replace multiple unmaintained systems. To do so, we chose React, Node, and Flask as the central points of our
              new stack. </p>
              <p>Along the way I also improved engineering processes by introducing agile practices, release cycles,
              mentored team members and helped improving interview procedures.</p>
