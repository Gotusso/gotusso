        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER - FIIT (CONTRACT -LONDON, UK. OCTOBER 2017– PRESENT)</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p><i>Fiit is a technology start-up on a mission to make fitness addictive.</i></p>
            <p>I joined Fiit in a very early stage as a full stack engineer to build the initial MVP. Working with 2 other
            engineers we're building from the ground up a mobile app, an API with Postgres and GraphQL and a few internal
            tools powered by React.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>LEAD WEB ENGINEER - LYST (LONDON, UK. JANUARY 2017– OCTOBER 2017)</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p><i>Lyst is a technology platform that helps fashion lovers find the right item, in the right size at the
            right price connecting them with millions of products from the world’s leading designers.</i></p>
            <p>During this period I joined the company to help them rethink their frontend development experience and
            move away from a custom Python framework to make teams more effective. To achieve this we built an isomorphic
            React application and a GraphQL API, progressively migrating different parts of the site.</p>
            <p>Other key responsibilities included recruiting and mentoring, ensuring site reliability and tight release
            processes to ensure rapid delivery.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>LEAD SOFTWARE ENGINEER - SMARKETS (LONDON, UK. APRIL 2015– JANUARY 2017)</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p><i>Smarkets is a betting exchange that offers a platform for trading on sporting, political and current
            affairs events.</i></p>
            <p>I led two different projects for Smarkets. First, a system to extract knowledge from multiple data sources
            to drive marketing decisions. This tool was composed by a ETL Python processor, an Elasticsearch cluster and
            a AngularJS UI to drill down into the data.</p>
            <p>After that, the next project was the creation of a new website and mobile app for the company, in order to
            replace multiple unmaintained systems. To do so, we chose React, Node and Flask as the central points of our
            new stack. </p>
            <p>Along the way I also improved engineering processes by introducing agile practices, release cycles,
            mentored team members and helped improving interview procedures.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER - SWISS MOBILITY SOLUTIONS (ALICANTE, SPAIN. JULY 2011 – MARCH 2015)</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p><i>Swiss Mobility Solutions is a provider of mobile broadband QoE and QoS testing solutions. Was bought by
            Gemalto, a world leader in digital security, in April 2014.</i></p>
            <p>As a software engineer I designed and developed web services and user interfaces for our administration,
            reporting and analysis tools for statistical and geolocated data, with technologies like Spring Boot and
            AngularJS. I also built domain specific languages and code generation tools to reduce the workload of the
            entire team</p>
